/**
 * A pairwise net, normalized so the pair `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are one row.
 *
 * Restricted to pairs `memberId` is part of: the caller is shown only their own
 * balances, so aggregating the whole household would compute and discard every
 * other pair — and the predicate lets this ride the debtor/creditor indexes
 * instead of scanning the household's entire history.
 *
 * Currency is in the GROUP BY because it costs one line and removes any chance
 * of adding EUR cents to USD cents. `sum(bigint)` returns `numeric`, which
 * node-postgres hands back as a **string** — every consumer below Number()s it
 * explicitly rather than letting `a + b` concatenate.
